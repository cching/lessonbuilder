Here is a copy of the picture.
In the book it said:  "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing. Afterward they are no longer able to move, and they sleep during the six months of their digestion."
In those days I thought a lot about jungle adventures, and eventually managed to make my first drawing, using a colored pencil. My drawing Number Once looked like this:


 



I showed the grown-ups my masterpiece, and I asked them if my drawing scared them.
 
They answered, "Why be scared of a hat?"
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. Then I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so the grown-ups could understand. They always need explanations. My drawing Number Two looked like this:


 




The grown-ups advised me to put away my drawings of boa constrictors, outside or inside, and apply myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and   grammar. That is why I abandoned, at the age of six, a magnificent career as an artist. I had been discouraged by the failure of my drawing Number One and   of my drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything but themselves, and it is exhausting for children to have to provide explanations over and over again.
So then I had to choose another career, and I learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown almost everywhere in the world.  And, as a matter of fact, geography has been a big help to me. I could tell China from Arizona at first glance, which is, very useful if you get lost during the night.
So I have had, in the course of my life, lots of encounters with lots of serous people. I have spent lots of time with grown-ups. I have seen them at close range...which hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
Whenever I encountered a grown-up who seemed to me at all enlightened, I would experiment on him with my drawing Number One, which I have always kept.  I wanted to see if he really understood anything. But he would always answer, "That's a hat." Then I wouldn't talk about boa constrictors or jungles or stars. I would put my, self on his level and talk about bridge and golf and politics and neckties.  And any grown-up was glad to know such a reasonable person.

So I lived all alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until I had to make a crash landing in the Sahara Desert six years ago. Something in my plane's engine had broken, and since I had neither a mechanic nor passengers in the plane with me, I was preparing to undertake the difficult repair job by myself. For me it was a matter of life or death:  I had only enough drinking water for eight days.
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any inhabited country.  I was more isolated than a man shipwrecked on a raft in the middle of the ocean. So you can imagine my surprise when I was awakened at daybreak by a funny little voice saying, "Please ... draw me a sheep ..."
"What?"
"Draw me a sheep ..."
I leaped up as if I had been struck by lightning. I rubbed my eyes hard. I stared. And I saw an extraordinary little fellow staring back at me very seriously. Here is the best portrait I managed to make of him, later on.  
But of course my drawing is much less attractive than my model. This is not my fault. My career as a painter was discouraged at the age of six by the grown-ups, and I had never learned to draw anything except boa constrictors, outside and inside.
So I stared wide-eyed at this apparition. Don't forget that I was a thousand miles from any inhabited territory. Yet this little fellow seemed to be neither lost nor dying of exhaustion, hunger, or thirst; nor did he seem scared to death. There was nothing in his appearance that suggested a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited territory. When I finally managed to speak, I asked him, "But ... what are you doing here?"
And then he repeated, very slowly and very seriously, "Please ... draw me a sheep ..."
In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey. Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket. But then I remembered that I had  mostly studied geography, history,  arithmetic, and grammar, and I  told the  little fellow (rather crossly) that I didn't know how to draw.
He replied, "That doesn't matter.  Draw me a sheep."<br /><br/><br/><i>The Little Prince</i><br/> Publisher: Translated by Richard Howard. Orlando: Harcourt, 2000. (1943) <br />
