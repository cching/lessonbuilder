(1941)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Homeward Bound</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The tramp steamer Drake plowed away from the coast of India and pushed its blunt prow into the Arabian Sea, homeward bound. Slowly it made its way west toward the Gulf of Aden. Its hold was loaded with coffee, rice, tea, oil seeds and jute. Black smoke poured from its one stack, darkening the hot cloudless sky.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Alexander Ramsay, Jr., known to his friends back home in New York City as Alec, leaned over the rail and watched the water slide away from the sides of the boat. His red hair blazed redder than ever in the hot sun; his tanned elbows rested heavily on the rail as he turned his freckled face back toward the fast-disappearing shore.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">It had been fun-those two months in India. He would miss Uncle Ralph, miss the days they had spent together in the jungle, even the screams of the panthers and the many eerie sounds of the jungle night. Never again would he think of a missionary&#39;s work as &quot;sissy&quot; work. No, sir, you had to be big and strong, able to ride horseback for long hours through the tangled jungle paths. Alec glanced down proudly at the hard muscles in his arms. Uncle Ralph had taught him how to ride--the one thing in the world he had always wanted to do.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">But it was all over now. Rides back home would be few.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">His fist opened. Lovingly he surveyed the pearl pocketknife he held there. The inscription on it was in gold: To Alec on his birthday, Bombay, India. He remembered, too, his uncle&#39;s words: &quot;A knife, Alec, comes in handy sometimes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Suddenly a large hand descended on his shoulder. &quot;Well, m&#39;boy, you&#39;re on your way home,&quot; a gruff voice said, with a decidedly English accent.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Alec looked up into the captain&#39;s wrinkled, wind&shy; tanned face. &quot;Hello, Captain Watson,&quot; he answered. &quot;It&#39;s rather a long way home, though, sir. To England with you and then to New York on the Majestic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;About four weeks sailing, all in all, lad, but you look like a pretty good sailor.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;I am, sir. I wasn&#39;t sick once all the way over and we had a rough crossing, too,&quot; Alec said proudly.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;When&#39;d you come over, lad&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;In June, sir, with some friends of my father&#39;s. They left me with my uncle in Bombay. You know my Uncle Ralph, don&#39;t you&#39;? He came aboard with me and spoke to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;Yes, I know your Uncle Ralph. A fine man, too.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&ldquo;And now you&#39;re going home alone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&quot;Yes, sir! School opens next month and I have to be there.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The captain smiled and took Alec by the arm. &quot;Come along,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll show you how we steer this ship and what makes it go.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The captain, the sailors, everybody on boat, was kind to Alec, but the days passed monotonously for the homeward-bound boy as the Drake steamed its way through the Gulf of Aden and into the Red Sea. The tropic sun beat down mercilessly on the heads of the few passengers aboard.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The Drake kept near the coast of Arabia-endless miles of barren desert shore. But Alec&#39;s thoughts were not on the scorching sand. Arabia-where the greatest horses in the world were bred! Did other fellows dream of horses the way he did to him, a horse was the grandest animal in the world.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Then one day the Drake headed for a small Arabian port. As they approached the small landing, Alec saw a crowd of natives milling about in great excitement. Obviously it was not often that a boat stopped there.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">But, as the gangplank went down with a bang, Alec could see that it wasn&#39;t the ship itself that was attracting all the attention. The natives were crowding toward the center of the landing. Alec heard a whistle shrill, loud, and clear, unlike anything he had ever heard before. He saw a mighty black horse rear on its hind legs, its forelegs striking out into the air. A white scarf was tied across its eyes. The crowd broke and ran.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">White lather ran from the horse&#39;s body; his mouth was open, his teeth bared. He was a giant of a horse, glistening black&mdash;too big to be pure Arabian. His mane was like a crest, mounting, then falling low. His neck was long and slender, and arched to the small, savagely beautiful head. The head was that of the wildest of all wild creatures-a stallion born wild-and it was beautiful, savage, and splendid. A stallion with a wonderful physical perfection that matched his savage, ruthless spirit.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Once again the Black screamed and rose on his hind legs. Alec could hardly believe his eyes and ears-a stallion, a wild stallion-unbroken, such as he had read and dreamed about!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Two ropes led from the halter on the horse&#39;s head, and four men were attempting to pull the stallion toward the gangplank. They were going to put him on the ship! Alec saw a dark-skinned man, wearing European dress and a high, white turban, giving directions. In his hand he held a whip. He gave his orders tersely in a language unknown to Alec. Suddenly he walked to the rear of the horse and let the hard whip fall on the Black&#39;s hind quarters. The stallion bolted so fast that he struck one of the natives holding the rope; down the man went and lay still. The Black snorted and plunged; if ever Alec saw hate expressed by a horse, he saw it then. They had him halfway up the plank. Alec wondered where they would put him if they ever did succeed in getting him on the boat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Then he was on!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><a href="#" name="b8e0ef44dcd9a3084f18decae02758e020ff8523"></a><a href="#" name="2"></a><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="c9"><tbody><tr class="c1"><td class="c3" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c18 c4">Resources</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c1"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c18 c5">.jpg</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c0"><a class="c16" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_1QfSA-eD09Rk40b0lRelRSbDQ/edit?usp=drivesdk">Test</a></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c1"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c18 c5">.doc</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c0"><a class="c16" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_1QfSA-eD09cHB6UHRwYXR0bXc/edit?usp=drivesdk">test</a></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c2 c15"><span class="c13"><a class="c16" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_1QfSA-eD09cHB6UHRwYXR0bXc/edit?usp=drivesdk"></a></span></p></body></html>
